Hi, firstly thank you for buying my package.

Set up instruction:
1. You need to install Universal RP package in Package Manager. Go to Window -> Package Manager -> Packages: Unity Registry -> Search: Universal RP
2. Then install and import the package.
3. Go to Edit -> Project Setting -> Graphics -> Drag the Pipeline Asset to the container.
4. Go to resource -> Data folder -> Data scriptable object -> Click "Reset All Data".

Sorry for any bug you got while experiencing as I'm not a professional package developer. However, I will try my best to help you.

Finally, feel free to ask me through my Discord account: Slothless#0137
